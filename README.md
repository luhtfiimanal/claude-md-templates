# Claude Code Templates

My personal collection of `CLAUDE.md` templates for different project types.

## Templates

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [`CLAUDE-RUST.md`](./CLAUDE-RUST.md) | Pure Rust projects with TDD workflow |
| [`CLAUDE-RUST-PYTHONTRUTH.md`](./CLAUDE-RUST-PYTHONTRUTH.md) | Rust + Python hybrid - uses Python libraries as test oracle for algorithms |

## Usage

1. Copy the template that fits your project
2. Rename to `CLAUDE.md` in your project root
3. Edit the "Project-Specific Configuration" section at the top
4. Done!

## What is CLAUDE.md?

`CLAUDE.md` is a configuration file for [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) that defines project-specific rules, workflows, and constraints. Claude will follow these instructions when working on your codebase.
